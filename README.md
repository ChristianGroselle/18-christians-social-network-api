## Description

---

This project is a back end api for a social network app using mongoose.

This was done by:

-Using mongoDb as the NoSQL database structure.\
-Utilizing mongoose for interacting with the database.\
-Utilizing express router to help modularize the routes.\
-Using Insomnia to test the routes.

This was done because:

-mongoDB excels in this use case due to the nature of non-relational databases.\
